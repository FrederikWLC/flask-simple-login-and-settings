		<p class="subtitle is-3">Picture this: Itâ€™s a cold winter evening and you just got of your closing-shift at the chocolate store. You head towards the train station to catch one going home. On your way there you spot two old classmates through windows of a fast food chain. You step in and greet them, and you start catching up. When it's time to leave you and one of your former classmate walk in the direction of the train station and realise that you're taking the same train home. A talk about what each of you are currently doing turns into a conversation on the frustration of not having a project to work on and ends up with an idea of an online meeting place where you can share ideas, visions and find the perfect team to help make your dreams come true. Stoked on the idea you completely miss your stop and are forced to wait half-an-hour before the next train taking you home arrives. The two of you brainstorm like crazy whilst walking home, and seconds after you separate you shoot him a text explaining how excited you are to finally have a project to work on, and on top of that, bring that same feeling to others. Just like that CTW was born and the rest, as they say, is history. <br>

		<br>This is what I, <strong>Nicolaj Terndrup</strong>, experienced the 23rd of January 2019, when I ran into <strong>Frederik Christoffersen</strong>, in a Danish fast food chain. Since that day, him and I have worked incredibly hard on making our dream of becoming successful entrepreneurs (and extending said dream to others via. CTW) true. In addition to experiencing what it means to run a business, and build a website from the ground up, we have also developed a close relation that has been formed through dealing with ups and downs with our company. It is our mission to give you guys a platform where you can develop the same kind of relationships as we have. A launchpad for your startup and your opportunity to experience growth and pain, ups and downs, and everything else that comes with being part of something new, just like we have. <br>

		<br>We work hard everyday to liberate you from that same frustration we were carrying around on that cold January evening. You're already in the right place. Now go on and explore everything our page has to offer, and start chasing your dreams today.
